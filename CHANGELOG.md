# Changelog

All notable changes to NSchema will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A new `IMigrationConfirmation` interface in `NSchema.Hosting` that can be used to seek confirmation before applying a migration. This is intended for interactive scenarios (e.g. CLI) where the user can review the plan and confirm before proceeding.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with the schema domain models where deserializing them could leave collection properties as `null` instead of empty.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Glob support for JSON schemas. `AddJsonSchemasFromGlob("schemas/**/*.json")` registers a provider for every matching file, and `AddJsonSchemasFromDirectory` now matches with the same globbing engine. Each file is aggregated like any other provider.
- `FileSchemaProvider`, a public base class for file-backed `ISchemaProvider`s. It handles file existence, stream lifetime, and schema-name filtering; derived providers implement only the format-specific `Parse`.
- `AddFileSchemasFromGlob` and `AddFileSchemasFromDirectory` builder methods, the shared file-discovery primitives behind the JSON helpers. Both take a provider factory so any file-backed provider can reuse the globbing.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where trying to register multiple desired schema providers of the same concrete type would only resolve the first one.

### Changed

- `UseStateStoreFile` is now `UseFileStateStore` to align with the other extension methods. The old method still exists, it's just been marked obsolete.
- Schema filtering now uses a dedicated `Filter` method on the `DatabaseSchema` model for better reuse and discoverability.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-01

Version 2 focuses on improving developer experience with a more explicit and extensible model for planning and applying changes. It also introduces an optional Terraform-style state store so that plans can be made against snapshots rather than a live database.

### Added

#### Backend state store (new)

By default NSchema plans against the live database, but this isn't always possible. A CI pipeline may have no way to reach the database, or you may want plans to reflect the last deployed state rather than any drift since then.

NSchema now supports an optional state store that persists a snapshot of the schema after every successful apply:

```csharp
builder.UseStateStoreFile("schema_state.json");
```

Once a store is registered, `Plan` operations automatically read from it instead of the live database (offline planning), while `Apply` operations always use the live database. No further configuration is needed.

A new `Refresh` operation captures the current live schema to the store without planning or applying anything. Use this to initialize the store, or to record drift that happened outside of NSchema.

`FileSchemaStateStore` is a ready-made file-backed implementation. Custom stores implement `ISchemaStateStore`. Alongside this release, there will be an `NSchema.Aws` package with an implementation for S3.

#### JSON schemas (new)

Desired schemas can now be declared in a JSON file instead of C#, so you can describe a schema without a compiled project:

```csharp
builder.AddJsonSchema("schema.json");
```

The file mirrors the schema model, with SQL types written as compact strings (`"int"`, `"varchar(255)"`, `"decimal(10,2)"`). Multiple files can be registered and are aggregated like any other provider. See [Defining schemas in JSON](docs/schemas.md#defining-schemas-in-json) for the format reference. This ships in the core package under the `NSchema.Json` namespace — no extra dependency — and is the foundation for the planned CLI front-end.

### Upgrading from 1.x

The API has changed significantly. This section is organised around what you need to do, depending on your role.

#### If you are a library user

**The default operation is now `Plan`.** NSchema will not apply changes unless you explicitly configure it with `RunOperation(MigrationOperation.Apply)` or call `app.Apply()`. This prevents accidental data loss when running NSchema for the first time.

- **`DryRun` / `DryRunOnly()` have been removed.** Use `RunOperation(MigrationOperation.Plan)` or `app.Plan()` instead.
- **`NSchemaApplication` now has explicit entry points.** `Plan()`, `Apply()`, and `Refresh()` methods that run a specific operation regardless of the configured default. `RunAsync()` still uses the configured operation.
- **`MigrationOptions` has been broken up.** Settings that control what gets migrated (`SchemaNames`, `DestructiveActionPolicy`) stay in `MigrationOptions`. Settings that control how a run executes (`Operation`, `TransactionMode`) have moved to `MigrationRunOptions` and `SqlExecutorOptions`. The builder methods still work as before; only direct reads of `IOptions<MigrationOptions>` need to change.
- **`PolicyError` has a new `Severity` property.** The existing 2-argument constructor still compiles, but custom `IMigrationPolicy` implementations should use `PolicySeverity.Warning` to signal non-fatal findings rather than returning errors.

#### If you are a database provider

- **`IMigrationReporter` has moved** to the `NSchema.Migration` namespace (was `NSchema.Hosting`). Update any `using` directives.
- **`IMigrationExecutor` and `UseMigrationExecutor<T>()` have been removed.** Implement `IMigrationCompiler` instead. A compiler receives a `MigrationPlan` and returns an executable `ICompiledMigration` unit. Register it with `UseMigrationCompiler<T>()`.
- **`UseCurrentSchema<T>()` is unchanged.** It still registers the live database provider. No action required.
- **`IMigrationPlanner` is now public** and its `Plan()` method now takes explicit `DatabaseSchema currentSchema` and `DatabaseSchema desiredSchema` parameters. If you have a custom planner implementation, update the signature. The planner is now a pure domain service — it no longer resolves schema providers from DI.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes weren't being displayed in the reported plan for new tables.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-27

First stable release. The public API is now covered by semantic versioning. Breaking changes will only ship in a new major version.

### Added

- Declarative schema definition via `AbstractSchemaProvider` and the fluent `Schema` / `Table` / `Column` / `Index` / `ForeignKey` builders.
- Hosted application model: `NSchemaApplication.CreateBuilder(...)` produces an `IHost`-backed app that runs the migration as a `BackgroundService`.
- A single `ISchemaProvider` interface used for both desired-state and current-state schemas, with the role determined at DI registration time (`AddSchema<T>()` / `UseSchemaSource<T>()`).
- Pluggable pipeline with extension points for every stage: `ISchemaPolicy`, `IMigrationPlanTransformer`, `IMigrationPolicy`, `IScriptProvider`, `ISqlPlanner`, `ISqlExecutor`, `IMigrationExecutor`.
- Rename detection for schemas, tables, and columns via `RenamedFrom(...)`.
- Migration options: `DestructiveActionPolicy` (`Error` / `Warn` / `Allow`), `DryRun`, `TransactionMode` (`Single` / `None`) with per-statement `RunOutsideTransaction` carve-outs, and `SchemaNames` scope filter via `ForSchemas(...)`.
- Built-in `ActionOrderingTransformer` (topological ordering of plan actions) and `DestructiveActionMigrationPolicy`.
- Pre- and post-deployment script support via `IScriptProvider`, `AddScriptFromFile(...)`, and `AddScriptsFromEmbeddedResources(...)`.
- SourceLink and symbol packages (`.snupkg`) published alongside the main package for source-level debugging.
