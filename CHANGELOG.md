# Changelog

All notable changes to NSchema will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-05-27

First stable release. The public API is now covered by semantic versioning — breaking changes will only ship in a new major version.

### Added

- Declarative schema definition via `AbstractSchemaProvider` and the fluent `Schema` / `Table` / `Column` / `Index` / `ForeignKey` builders.
- Hosted application model: `NSchemaApplication.CreateBuilder(...)` produces an `IHost`-backed app that runs the migration as a `BackgroundService`.
- A single `ISchemaProvider` interface used for both desired-state and current-state schemas, with the role determined at DI registration time (`AddSchema<T>()` / `UseSchemaSource<T>()`).
- Pluggable pipeline with extension points for every stage: `ISchemaPolicy`, `IMigrationPlanTransformer`, `IMigrationPolicy`, `IScriptProvider`, `ISqlPlanner`, `ISqlExecutor`, `IMigrationExecutor`.
- Rename detection for schemas, tables, and columns via `RenamedFrom(...)`.
- Migration options: `DestructiveActionPolicy` (`Error` / `Warn` / `Allow`), `DryRun`, `TransactionMode` (`Single` / `None`) with per-statement `RunOutsideTransaction` carve-outs, and `SchemaNames` scope filter via `ForSchemas(...)`.
- Built-in `ActionOrderingTransformer` (topological ordering of plan actions) and `DestructiveActionMigrationPolicy`.
- Pre- and post-deployment script support via `IScriptProvider`, `AddScriptFromFile(...)`, and `AddScriptsFromEmbeddedResources(...)`.
- SourceLink and symbol packages (`.snupkg`) published alongside the main package for source-level debugging.
